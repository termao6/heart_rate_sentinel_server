# Heart Rate Sentinel Server
## As of 11/16 Midnight:
* server.py has API endpoints that work locally (as tested through Postman)
## Update 3:00
* added tests for API endpoints
  * there is something funny going on with importing functions from server.py that I'll look into again later (maybe)
* TODO: 
  * Travis CI?
  * SendGrid API
  * Get server on VM
  * ...that sounds like a lot
